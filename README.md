# Simple Rune Maker
An app to set runes manually in League of Legends, but out of the client. (In case your client is so laggy you can't set your runes)

App is on alpha so only some few functions are available: display your selected rune, modify and save it, and reload in case you edited the runes from the client.
Except some bugs.

Only available for windows x64 for now.

## Installation instructions
1. Execute the setup you downloaded from [Releases](https://github.com/IzaakSantana/simple-rune-maker/releases)
2. A shortcut will appear in your desktop, run it

## How to use:
1. Open your League Client
2. Run the Simple Rune Maker app
3. Set your runes and have fun!

**IMPORTANT!** - After saving the rune page, click reload before saving a new rune or else it won't work. (will be fixed on next release)

In case of any bugs or erros, close the Simple Rune Maker app and open again.
